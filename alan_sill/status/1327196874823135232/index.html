  	      @blelbach @Supercomputing The same debate takes place with regard to non-conference publication. Should journals etc. be free to access, meaning authors bear all the publication and online tool maintenance costs, or free to publish, meaning readers should be charged? Which is more of a burden to fairness?

  	      @blelbach @Supercomputing The current swing of the pendulum is towards free-to-access (which means charge-to-publish) as being less of a barrier to scholarship but clearly simply shifts the barrier to another end of the activity. Conferences are a weird hybrid: charge both ends but give student discounts.
