  	      I'd consider it a success if we got 200 responses with a week of running the survey on a potential HPC social community at <a href="https://survey.hpc.social">https://survey.hpc.social</a>.  So far we are at 168 responses in less than 1 day. Please keep this going and please forward the link to other places in the world!

  	      202 responses as of this morning, 1.5 days after publication of the survey. Too many to ignore, so we will have to think about the next steps.

  	      In the spirit of community creation of open standards and infrastructures (something I have some considerable experience doing): thank you to all who answered especially to those raising criticisms or questions. Experience shows that paying attention to these is vital to success.
