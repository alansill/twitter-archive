  	      1) There is *substantial* interest from those in HPC and related fields in finding each other and communicating effectively in a social media setting. For some, this means a new platform but for  others, it means keeping hold of what they have.  2/n

  	      Continuing with conclusions from <a href="https://survey.hpc.social">https://survey.hpc.social</a> so far:<br>3) We need to find a way to harness the energy of those who *do* want to create new channels to do so w/out losing the value of existing channels for those who use them. Ideally, add and not subtract usefulness. 5/n

  	      My conclusion from this is that we need to create a new service that lets those using existing or new social media in the hpc (and related fields) space easily, in a self-elected way, voluntarily and without adding complication. 6/n

  	      I think this is possible and can even add considerable usefulness to existing media channels for those who use them and now have to think about and design something that will do this, with the option to support links to new venues like Mastodon. 7/n

  	      I will also respond to this topic here on the bird app and on @AlanSill@mastodon.social but overall I want those who filled out the survey at <a href="https://survey.hpc.social">https://survey.hpc.social</a> to know (THANK YOU) that we were and are listening to you. Still time to fill it out if you haven't yet!  9/9 end
