  	      @peglarr @cdespinosa @ergonzalez This was the computer I used at @lewisandclark for first course in Numerical Methods in 1974. (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130</a>) It was the college's only computer at the time. Class got to use it in the evenings, college admin during the days. It had exactly these peripherals. <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1160575824082460673-EBsxiDpW4AABfym.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1160575824082460673-EBsxiDpW4AABfym.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      @peglarr @cdespinosa @ergonzalez @lewisandclark Interesting bit of trivia: When the compiler hit an error it would divert all further cards from the input deck directly into the output chute. Embarrassing in a public class setting as this sounded different to normal reads. Peer pressure from this made me a better programmer!

  	      @peglarr @cdespinosa @ergonzalez @lewisandclark The fastest of the 1130s had a 2.2 microsecond cpu processing time (about 450 kHz) and 64 kB of memory (Source: <a href="http://ibm1130.org/hw/cpu/">http://ibm1130.org/hw/cpu/</a>). The cluster we are about to put in at @texastech will thus be about 3.6 billion times faster and have 1.9 billion times as much main memory.
