  	      I know my limits. Particle physics, cloud/grid computing, HPC, a bit of woodworking/home repair, a few multilingual swear words from my childhood that'll crack an egg from 50 paces, that's enough for me. As Monty Python said, knowing everything would take the mystery out of life!

  	      But I do know this: you should stay home if at all possible and as much as possible, listen to the @CDCgov advice, do what you can within this to help others, and wash your bleeping hands! (Also ignoring advice from any orange politicians who pop up in your feed would be good.)
