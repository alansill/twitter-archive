  	      @CaprockDemocrat @lubbockdems The domination of this area by Republican policies driven by their machine politics and misguided social issues has hurt, not helped, the South Plains and it is high time for someone like Stuart to step forward and point this out. Well done, Happy New Year, and let's get them!
