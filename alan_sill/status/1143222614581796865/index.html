  	      @peakscale But commercial cloud for bulk HPC does not make economic sense at the present time and cannot reach financial equity with a well-run on-premises HPC center. I'd be the first to say so if it did, but it doesn't. There are cases where it works well, but not yet for most cases. 2/2
