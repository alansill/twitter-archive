  	      @hpcprogrammer Current shortcomings of Slurm: It lacks several established standard interfaces, such as DRMAA (though there's a community patch for the older v1). It only recently gained a restful API and that API was not designed along OpenAPI principles. It interfaces poorly with much of MPI.

  	      @hpcprogrammer Despite all of these shortcomings, it's our current HPC scheduler of choice and we are working to try to remedy some of these defects by selective bug reporting and building our own interfaces where needed (along with others for preference). Community work encouraged here!
