  	      @hpcnotes @HPC_James To be clear: As a veteran of processes we used to start interest in clouds many years ago including @NIST SAJACC and @cloudplugfest I have no objection to commercial cloud providers or the tremendous advantages their presence brings to essentially everything we do these days.

  	      @hpcnotes @HPC_James @NIST @CloudPlugfest "Democratizing access" or even realizing large reductions in cost for bulk computing for scientific applications however remains elusive and among the up to now unrealized promises we were making. One of the reasons is that in the US at least there really are no "public" clouds.

  	      @hpcnotes @HPC_James @NIST @CloudPlugfest @opensciencegrid The real problem with the idea behind "democratizing access" to computing, data transfer, and storage is that the people who say these things don't have their hearts in the idea. It remains marketing and to be treated as such.
