  	      @HPC_Guru @intel @Tobias_Writes @TheRegister There’s a lot of nice technology in their roadmap and I still think they have a role to play. Would like to see the new directions and execution work out, but meanwhile there are multiple types of new directions from competition including some that may change the nature of HPC.
