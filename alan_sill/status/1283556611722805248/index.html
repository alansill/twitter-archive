  	      @changelog @mrlacey @Fermilab People were so used to their jobs taking a long time in the queue that no one had noticed. The database used a direct access method using DEC’s RMS file system to manage content within files for speed. The problem was an overly aggressive 2-way lock mechanism that had gridlocked.

  	      @changelog @mrlacey @Fermilab Much later in Run II when we had switched to a full Oracle database system, we solved a more pernicious problem w/ worldwide access by implementing database call monitoring via UDP broadcasts that allowed us to develop the FroNtier squid caching system still in use at CERN today.
