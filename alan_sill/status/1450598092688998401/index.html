  	      I’m a strong supporter and advocate for @NSF and all the great work that it enables, but every organization has odd foibles that it promotes into culture without sufficient review and periodic introspection. A better example of the culture of “creaming” would be hard to find tbh.

  	      Specifically, the odd idea that each proposal for computational resource development must be justified by a few showpiece examples of premium science just ignores the overwhelming evidence that computing and certainly data are now intrinsically needed for *every* field of study.

  	      To accomplish this requires a wholesale rewriting of @NSF culture with the goal to bring it, at least with respect to research computing and data topics, into contact with the modern world.
