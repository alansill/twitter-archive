  	      @walkingrandomly @owainkenway @Dr_GHill Academics can't build data centers of that size and hence reap the savings because they don't have a source of capital subsidized by overpricing their services. So the gap widens. The only way to beat this economics is to change the way computing is designed, served, &amp; delivered.
