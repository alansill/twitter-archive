  	      @HPC_Guru @eetimes @Meta I wish this article were true. I and many others have spent years building software and tools to try to help realize this dream. As it is, itâ€™s a triumph of marketing over reality and lazy journalism that keeps producing articles of this type based entirely on fluff with no data.
