  	      @LorenaABarba You basically had to teach only how to answer canned questions in a number of categories in a formulaic way. No understanding or physical insight was possible unless it happened by accident or by a particularly well-motivated student.

  	      @LorenaABarba This only started to change when we hired a physics education expert. Still, years later, there is substantial resistance within the department to using more effective methods, and these have not penetrated the service courses.
